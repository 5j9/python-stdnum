This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.nl.cpf module. It
tries to test more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not
really useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum.br import cpf


These are normal variations that should just work.

>>> cpf.is_valid('39053344705')
True
>>> cpf.is_valid('23100299900')
False

These are tests to check what happens when a wrong type is passed.

>>> cpf.is_valid(39053344705) # integer, not string
False
>>> cpf.is_valid(None)
False
>>> cpf.is_valid('')
False
